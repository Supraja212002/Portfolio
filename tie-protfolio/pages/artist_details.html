            name: "SWATI PASARI",
            bio: "Swati Pasari is a young and talented artist who has gained recognition for her distinct style of painting. Her works primarily revolve around themes of immortality, timelessness, inner stillness, peace, and meditation. Despite her relatively short time as an artist since 2007, her paintings reflect a remarkable artistic maturity. Swati art serves as a reflection of her inner soul and portrays a sense of joy and celebration of life. Each of her artistic creations is an expression of her search for inner peace and wholeness. She believes that art is a means to find inner tranquility, and she immerses herself in a different dimension when she paints. She doesn't know what the painting will become until it is completed, but she follows her intuition and allows the process to unfold naturally. Determining when a painting is complete is an intuitive process for Swati. She experiences an inner feeling of completeness when she looks at the painting. She sees a complete form of the original thought or idea that inspired her to start the painting. This sense of fulfillment indicates to her that the artwork is finished. Swati Pasari considers each of her paintings as a mirror that reflects her identity and beliefs. As a Pranic Healer, she possesses a strong spiritual side, which influences her artistic creations. Most of her paintings are imbued with the intention of spreading positivity and uplifting the viewers.Despite her relatively short career, Swati Pasari has already exhibited her paintings in various parts of India and abroad. Her artistic excellence has gained recognition and admiration, leading to multiple upcoming exhibitions. Swati journey as an artist reflects her passion for painting and her constant exploration of self-expression through art.",
